I would use Docker to work on my code and setting up the right environment and then share the container with others where they will be able to run it and use it in the same environment and get the same results. However I would use Singularity if am a researcher working on High-performance computing (HPC) and also where I would like to share my work but with more restrictions and privileges on what other users can access.
